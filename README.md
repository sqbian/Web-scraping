# Web-scraping

I put the codes for web-scraping projects here.

pubmed.R is the program for web-scraping the search results from pubmed http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/. The program will go through each result on each page, click the link to open it and then write the link, title, author and abstract into a local table. 

googlescholar.R is the program for web-scraping the search results from google scholar.
